# Spot Welder
This is a home made spot welder which use a transformer from a micro-wave
It is controlled by a esp01 (esp8266) which  acts as a webserver and receive commands from a dedicated app on a smartphone
The app is made with MIT App Inventor and is very simple
The next version will be done with the esp01 in access point mode so you don't need any router to use (just connect with the smartphone on the esp)
